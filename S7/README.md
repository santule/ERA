## Building an effecient DNN - from 6M parameters to 8K parameters


### MODEL 1 - the basic

#### Targets:
1. Get the set-up right
2. Set Transforms
3. Set Data Loader
4. Set Basic Working Code
5. Set Basic Training  & Test Loop

#### Results:
1. Parameters: 6.3M
2. Best Training Accuracy: 99.9
3. Best Test Accuracy: 99.3
#### Analysis:
1. very heavy model for a simple MNIST dataset.
2. From epoch 5 to 15, the model is there is consistent gap between training and testing accuracy.
